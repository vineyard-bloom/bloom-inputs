# Bloom Inputs
### Accessible inputs in React

## What & Why
This library provides fully-accessible, reusable input components with easily-overridable default styles. They don't depend on Redux or other stateful libraries to function, but it's recommended to use them with [bloom-forms](https://github.com/vineyard-bloom/bloom-forms), as the HOC form wrapper there provides all the needed hooks.

The requirements surrounding accessibility in user-driven fields can be a lot of remember, especially when custom components (for stylability) are used. Bloom-inputs tries to solve this problem by providing drop-in inputs of many types.

## Live Example
You can boot up an example form in a browser to play with the inputs by going into this repo's /example folder.
Install dependencies with `npm install` and run with `npm run dev`. The inputs are imported directly from the root, so changes to those will be reflected immediately.

## Installation
`npm install bloom-inputs`

or

`yarn add bloom-inputs`
